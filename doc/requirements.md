## Including the Class-List in the JAR

`req~include-class-list-in-jar~1`

We want to include the class list in the JAR.

Rationale:
That bundles it with a certain release, so customers don't need to handle an additional file. It also reduces the risk that customers update tha jar file but not the class list.

Needs: dsn
